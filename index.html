                Unlike other maps, OpenStreetMap is completely <abbr title='OpenStreetMap has over 1 million users, who add data based on local knowledge, GPS tracks, and more'>created
                by people like you</abbr>,
                and free for anyone to fix, update, download and use.
                Here's a quick guide to get you started!

                If you're here to correct an error you found on a site like
                Foursquare or Craigslist, you're in the right place - OpenStreetMap
                is the central map database used by hundreds of websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                You just need to edit OpenStreetMap, and the changes will be visible
                everywhere else. Copying the map data from place to place
                can take from a few minutes to a few hours, so don't worry if it isn't instant.

                    OpenStreetMap is a place for any data that's both
                    <em>real and current</em> - it includes millions of buildings, roads,
                    and other details about places.

                    like historical buildings or hypothetical structures.
