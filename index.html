                OpenStreetMap is a free map that you can edit.
                Here's a quick guide to get you started!

                <h3><span class='step'>1</span> One Database - Many Applications</h3>
                <p>
                If you're here to correct an error you found on a site like
                Foursquare or Craigslist, you're in the right place - OpenStreetMap
                is the central database used by hundreds of websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                You just
                need to edit OpenStreetMap, and the changes will be visible
                everywhere else. Copying from place to place can take a few minutes
                to a few hours, so don't worry if it isn't instant.

                <h3><span class='step'>2</span> What's on the Map</h3>
                <p>
                OpenStreetMap is a place for any data that's both
                real and current - it includes millions of buildings, roads,
                and other details about places.
                </p>
                <p>What it <em>doesn't</em> include
                is opinionated data, like ratings, or data that isn't current,
                like historical buildings or hypothetical structures.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class='pad2'>
                <h3><span class='step'>3</span> Get a Free Account</h3>
                <p>
                To edit OpenStreetMap, you'll need <a target='_blank'
                    href='https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new'>a free user account - sign up here</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class='pad2'>
                <h3><span class='step'>4</span> Learn to edit</h3>
                <p>
                Editing the map isn't too hard: the easiest way to start
                is with 'iD Editor', which runs in your browser.
