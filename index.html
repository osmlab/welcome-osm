                Unlike other maps, OpenStreetMap is completely created
                by people like you,
                and free for anyone to fix, update, download and use.
                Here's a quick guide to get you started!

                <h3><span class='step'>1</span> One Map: Many Websites</h3>
                <p>
                If you're here to correct an error you found on a site like
                Foursquare or Craigslist, you're in the right place - OpenStreetMap
                is the central database used by hundreds of websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                You just
                need to edit OpenStreetMap, and the changes will be visible
                everywhere else. Copying from place to place can take a few minutes
                to a few hours, so don't worry if it isn't instant.

                    OpenStreetMap is a place for any data that's both
                    <em>real and current</em> - it includes millions of buildings, roads,
                    and other details about places.

                    <p>What it <em>doesn't</em> include
                    is opinionated data, like ratings, or data that isn't current,
                    like historical buildings or hypothetical structures.

                    If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Just go to <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org/'>osm.org</a>
                    and click <em>'Add a note'</em> in the <em>bottom-right corner</em>.
                    This will add a marker to the map, which you can move by dragging
                    the green plus sign. Click save to add a note, and experienced
                    mappers will find and address your issue.
